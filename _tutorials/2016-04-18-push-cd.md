Continuous deployment is the process of releasing new versions of software in a
reliable and automatic way. Through automation the risk of human error is
minimized because manual tasks are replaced by a formalized release
process that is predictable and safer. Although numerous solutions
for continuous deployment exist for traditional servers and virtual machines,
not many established solutions exist in the container landscape yet.

This tutorial shows you how to set up an environment for handling continuous
deployment on Docker Swarm. In the process, you will perform the following
tasks:

1. Set up automated builds on Docker Hub for your application.
2. Set up webhooks that are triggered after every build.
3. Deploy a container that monitors those webhooks.
4. Deploy application changes and watch them be deployed across your Swarm cluster.

### Prerequisite

* [Create and connect to a cluster](/docs/getting-started/create-connect-cluster/)

### Set up a custom Docker image

To begin, you need to need to have a Git repository hosted either on GitHub or
Bitbucket. This repository will store your application codebase and
the Dockerfile that specifies how your application is packaged in its
environment.

If you already have a codebase and Dockerfile in GitHub or Bitbucket, skip
to [Set up automated builds](#set-up-automated-builds).

If not, you need to create a test application and push it to GitHub. For
simplicity, this tutorial uses a minimal Dockerfile that extends
the base Python 3 Docker image and runs a Flask app. In a later section,
you will add more logic to simulate codebase/feature changes and then
release it.

Go to the [Carina examples repository](https://github.com/getcarina/examples)
and fork it. If you are unsure how to do this, consult [GitHub's documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).

###Â Set up automated builds

An automated build enables you to build your Docker images automatically from a
build context stored in a repository. A build context is a Dockerfile and any
files at a specific location. Automated builds are supported for both public and
private Docker Hub repositories on both GitHub and Bitbucket.

To set up an automated build, follow these steps:

1. Log in to Docker Hub
2. In the top-right corner, click **Create > Create Automated Build**.
3. Click **Create Auto-build GitHub** button.
4. Select your GitHub username from the left column and the name of your
   repository from the right column (such as ``examples``).
5. Specify ``hello-world-app`` as the image name, add a short description,
   and click **Create**.
6. Go to **Build Settings**.
7. In the master branch row, specify ``/hello-world-app`` for the Dockerfile
   location. Then, click **Save Changes**.
8. To initiate the first build, click **Trigger**.
9. Wait for the first build to complete (a few minutes). You can see the
   build status by going to the Build Details page. A green Success status
   is displayed when the build has finished.

### Deploy applications

You now need to deploy your application of choice. If you have an existing
codebase that you want to deploy, you need to handle this step by
yourself because you are already aware of how to run and deploy it.

If you forked the Carina examples repository at the beginning of this
tutorial, you can deploy the Flask app by using the following commands.
Be sure to replace `<dockerHubUsername>` with your Docker Hub username.

```
$ export DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME=<dockerHubUsername>

$ docker run --detach --name app1 --publish 8001:5000 $DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME/hello-world-app
00b2ef7dff1a7b596eabf2495e445b76576e89b0846baa35f66735e72d29272d

$ docker run --detach --name app2 --publish 8002:5000 $DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME/hello-world-app
8ef8a6bb2a172b792823fd5fb8ff25798e65bafd06575560f0f351b12c0f1119
```

### Run wiretap container

The next step is to deploy *wiretap*, a web server that listens for Docker Hub
notifications and redeploys containers after their underlying image is updated.

1. Generate a secret by running something like:

  ```
  $ export SECRET=$(xxd -l 20 -p /dev/urandom)
  ```

  or

  ```
  $ export SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 20)
  ```

  Your secret *must be URL-friendly*, so avoid including characters
  that require encoding and decoding. This value is required for wiretap to
  accept the incoming request. This step prevents abuse and provides a basic
  level of authorization.

2. Deploy the container itself:

  ```
  $ docker run --detach \
    --name wiretap \
    --publish 8000:8000 \
    --volumes-from swarm-data \
    --env TOKEN=$SECRET \
    --env DOCKER_HOST=$DOCKER_HOST \
    --env DOCKER_CERT_PATH=/etc/docker/cert.pem \
    --env DOCKER_KEY_PATH=/etc/docker/key.pem \
    --env DOCKER_CA_CERT_PATH=/etc/docker/ca.pem \
    carina/wiretap
  ```

3. Save the webhook URL for your wiretap container:

  ```
  $ export WEBHOOK_URL="http://$(docker port wiretap 8000)/listen?token=$SECRET"
  $ echo $WEBHOOK_URL
  http://1.2.3.4:8000/listen?token=Y4eNUiPzO4NRX5d35R6tkUokd6FFY1EbWVW1Ad39
  ```

4. Copy the `WEBHOOK_URL` value to your clipboard.

### Set up the Docker Hub webhook

Webhooks are user-defined HTTP callbacks and are usually triggered by some event,
such as pushing code to a repository. When that event occurs, the source site
makes an HTTP request to the URI configured for the webhook. Users can
configure them to cause events on one site to invoke behavior on another.

Docker Hub allows you to configure webhooks that will be triggered every time
code is pushed to your GitHub or Bitbucket repository.

1. Go to the Webhooks page for your image on Docker Hub.
2. Click the button under **Create a Webhook**.
3. Specify ``wiretap`` for the webhook name, and paste the ``WEBHOOK_URL``
   value from the preceding section as the webhook URL.
4. Click **Save**.

### Push code changes to GitHub

If you are running your own custom application, now is the time to commit
new functionality and push to your upstream VCS repository's master branch.

Otherwise, to order to simulate a new feature being released, you will add a
new API operation to your Flask app. The new operation allows users to
perform a GET request to query the latest API version.

1. Check that this operation is not currently implemented, by running the following
   cURL command and verifying that a 404 error is returned:

  ```
  $ curl "$(docker port app1 5000)/version"
  <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN">
  <title>404 Not Found</title>
  <h1>Not Found</h1>
  <p>The requested URL was not found on the server.  If you entered the URL manually please check your spelling and try again.</p>
  ```

2. Check out your Flask application, if you haven't already:

  ```
  $ git clone https://github.com/getcarina/examples
  $ cd hello-world-app
  ```

3. Add the following lines to the ``app.py`` file, below the current
   ``hello`` method (around line 11):

  ```python
  @app.route('/version')
  def version():
      return '1.1'
  ```

4. Commit the change and push to your master branch:

  ```
  $ git commit -m "Adds versioning" app.py
  $ git push -u origin master
  ```

### Test changes

Docker Hub is notified of your push to GitHub and builds a new
Docker image for your application automatically. After this build is finished,
Docker Hub will notify wiretap of the changes, enabling it to redeploy any
containers that are running the specified image. You can see that a new image
is being built by going to the Build Details page on Docker Hub.

You can see this process at work by viewing wiretap's logs:

```
$ docker logs -f wiretap
time="2016-04-19T10:55:50Z" level=info msg="Pulling newer image" Image="jamiehannaford/hello-world-app"
time="2016-04-19T10:56:23Z" level=info msg="Killing container" ID=80e3bd1d15fb3512980e52343b8a581f79c074ef77f3b1289b2c1f8917dbc00b Name=app1 Signal=SIGTERM
time="2016-04-19T10:56:24Z" level=info msg="Removing container" ID=80e3bd1d15fb3512980e52343b8a581f79c074ef77f3b1289b2c1f8917dbc00b
time="2016-04-19T10:56:25Z" level=info msg="New container created" ID=7d044a8c7459a54a634e5c47785dbf4fb15a3b9726530c5f26c766a73047ce4d Name=app1
time="2016-04-19T10:56:25Z" level=info msg="Pulling newer image" Image="jamiehannaford/hello-world-app"
time="2016-04-19T10:56:26Z" level=info msg="Killing container" ID=9cb725e79bd0e164c6f99d481c80684c910610f504cf165a0291bd141485c259 Name=app2 Signal=SIGTERM
time="2016-04-19T10:56:27Z" level=info msg="Removing container" ID=9cb725e79bd0e164c6f99d481c80684c910610f504cf165a0291bd141485c259
time="2016-04-19T10:56:27Z" level=info msg="New container created" ID=cef70e8101b3303f35af885532ffac7a83805389dc2b55452fb9c26f0c091333 Name=app2
```

You can see that wiretap has been notified and has successfully shut down the two applications
and redeployed them using a new image.

To test that your new feature is live, you can run cURL again:

```
$ curl "$(docker port app1 5000)/version"
1.1
$ curl "$(docker port app2 5000)/version"
1.1
```

Success! The feature has been released using automated builds and continuous deployment. This will
happen for every new feature or bug fix in the future, just by pushing to GitHub or Bitbucket.

### Troubleshooting

If you receive an `Invalid Request` error message in wiretap's logs, it is because the incoming
request did not satisfy the following requirements:

- It must be a `POST` request with a well-formed JSON payload
  ([documented here](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/webhooks/)).
- It must contain a token query parameter in its URL that matches the `TOKEN` environment
  variable specified when wiretap was first run.

You can also run `curl` against your webhook and see what happens:

```
$ cat > wh.json <<EOF
