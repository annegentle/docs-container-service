Docker supports running the Docker Toolbox on Windows systems. You can use a Docker client directly from your Windows machine to manage containers that are running on Linux hosts.

###Prerequisites
To run Docker on Windows, your system must be running Windows 7.1 or later.

Ensure that your Windows system supports Hardware Virtualization Technology and that virtualization is enabled. Use the following instructions.

####For Windows 8 or Windows 8.1

1. Select **Start** > **Task Manager** and click the **Performance** tab.

1. Under **CPU**, verify that the value for **Virtualization** is **Enabled**.

1. If virtualization is *not* enabled, follow the manufacturerâ€™s instructions for enabling it.

####For Windows 7

Download the [Microsoft Hardware-Assisted Virtualization Detection Tool] (http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=592) and follow the instructions.
