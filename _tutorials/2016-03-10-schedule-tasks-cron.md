This tutorial explains how to configure a container that runs the ubiquitous job scheduler [cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) to perform arbitrary tasks on a schedule. Scheduled tasks are commonly used to run backups, clean up temporary files, or perform other routine maintenance.

### Prerequisite

* [Create and connect to a cluster](/docs/getting-started/create-connect-cluster/)

### Create a cron image

1. Run the following command to create empty directories for each of the default cron intervals:

    ```bash
    mkdir -p tasks/{15min,hourly,daily,weekly,monthly}
    ```
1. In the `tasks/15min` folder, create a file named `get-servicenet-ip` , with the following contents:

    ```bash
    #!/bin/sh

    echo "Public IP: $(docker run --rm --net=host racknet/ip service ipv4)"
    ```

    This simple shell script runs the [`racknet/ip`](https://hub.docker.com/r/racknet/ip/) Docker image and displays the ServiceNet address of the node on which it runs. Because you created the file in `tasks/15min/`, cron runs this script every 15 minutes. You can place files in the other directories that you created to have them run every hour, day, week, or month as the names of each directory indicate.

    **Tip:** You can add your own executable files to the directories in `tasks/`, but be sure that they don't have filename extensions. This implementation of cron does not run files that have filename extensions.

1. Create a file named `Dockerfile` with the following contents:

    ```Dockerfile
    FROM alpine:3.3

    RUN apk add --update --no-cache docker

    COPY tasks/ /etc/periodic/
    RUN chmod -R +x /etc/periodic/

    RUN mkdir -p /var/run/docker && \
      ln -s /etc/docker/ca.pem /var/run/docker/ca.pem && \
      ln -s /etc/docker/server-cert.pem /var/run/docker/cert.pem && \
      ln -s /etc/docker/server-key.pem /var/run/docker/key.pem

    CMD ["crond", "-f", "-d", "8"]
    ```

    In this Dockerfile, youâ€™re performing the following actions:

    1. Extending the [Alpine Linux Docker Image](https://github.com/gliderlabs/docker-alpine)
    1. Using Alpine's package manager, `apk`, to install Docker, allowing this container to run Docker commands.
    1. Copying all the files and folders that you created in the `tasks/` directory to the location in Alpine where scheduled tasks are stored, and ensuring that they can be executed by cron
    1. Creating a directory and symlinks for the certificates that this container needs to communicate with your Carina cluster
    1. Running the `crond` daemon in the foreground (so your container doesn't exit right away) and outputting the logs to stderr (so you can see the output of your scheduled tasks by using `docker logs`)

1. Build the image and assign it a tag by running the following command:

    ```bash
    docker build -t cron .
    ```

### Run the cron container

Start the cron container with the following command:

```bash
docker run \
--env DOCKER_HOST=${DOCKER_HOST} \
--env DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=${DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY} \
--env DOCKER_CERT_PATH=/var/run/docker/ \
--detach \
--name my-cron-container \
--volumes-from swarm-data \
cron
```

Docker returns the ID of the newly created container. The cron container should now run forever and run the `racknet/ip` image once every 15 minutes.

### Troubleshooting

See [Troubleshooting common problems]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/troubleshooting/common-problems/).

For additional assistance, ask the [community](https://community.getcarina.com/) for help or join us in IRC at [#carina on Freenode](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=carina).

### Next step

Do something more useful with your cron container, like [renew Let's Encrypt SSL certificates]({{ site.baseurl}}/docs/tutorials/nginx-with-lets-encrypt/#reissue-certificates-with-a-cron-container).
