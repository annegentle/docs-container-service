faqs:
  -
    question: I am an existing Rackspace customer. Can I use Carina with my existing account?
    answer: |
      You can use your existing Rackspace account username (the same you use for the Cloud Control Panel) to sign into Carina. The Beta will also be free to you, just like everyone else.
  -
    question: I've got some feedback or questions. Where can I go for this?
    answer: |
      During the Beta period Carina is supported through [community forums](https://community.getcarina.com/) and [IRC at #carina on Freenode](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=carina).
  -
    question: I've found a bug. Where can I go to report it?
    answer: |
      We're happy to receive bug reports from you. All bugs related to Carina in general (CLI, UI, docs, back end) should be issued to [github.com/getcarina/feedback](https://github.com/getcarina/feedback/issues). If the bug is security related, refer to our [Security Vulnerability Reporting guidelines](http://www.rackspace.com/information/legal/rsdp/).
  -
    question: Can I use Carina for production workloads?
    answer: |
      We're still working hard to add new features to Carina. As a result, there may be some changes we have to make to the environment. Most changes won't impact your running clusters containers. When we move into production there will likely be major interruptions, but we will give you plenty of warning and guidance. Please treat Carina as an experimental Beta; we'll be doing our best to ensure uptime, but ultimately won't be able to guarantee it.

      You can mitigate this risk by always ensuring your workloads restart. On Swarm clusters, you can start your containers with the `--restart always` option, which ensures they restart after node or host restart. On Kubernetes clusters, you can specify `RestartPolicy: Always` in the Pod Manifest.
  -
    question: What happens when a new version of Docker or Kubernetes is released?
    answer: |
      When a new version of upstream software is released, we'll test it in our environment. After testing, we'll make it available in Carina, at which point any new cluster build will use the newer version. **Running clusters won't be upgraded by default**, so you will have to redeploy your application into a new cluster to take advantage of the newer version.
  -
    question: Using <code>-v /node-dir:/container-dir</code> option in Docker doesn't seem to work. Why?
    answer: |
      Carina uses AppArmor to provide additional security to the environment. This means you'll only be allowed to bind-mount from the `/var/lib/docker` node directory. As a result any `-v` directive should looks like this: `-v /var/lib/docker:/container-dir`.
  -
    question: Specifying PersistentVolumes in a Kubernetes manifest causes Pods to fail. Why?
    answer: |
      Carina uses AppArmor to provide additional security to the environment. For this reason, you cannot at present use PersistentVolumes in your cluster.
  -
    question: I am having trouble running my container. What can I do?
    answer: |
      We've published a tutorial to [troubleshoot common problems]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/troubleshooting/common-problems/). If you continue to have problems, use our [forums and ask our community](https://community.getcarina.com).
  -
    question: What resources does a single cluster have?
    answer: |
      All cluster nodes currently have 40 GB of disk space, 8 GB of memory, and roughly the equivalent of 12 vCPUs. As a result, a single **Docker container in your cluster can never grow larger than 8 GB of memory**. By default, you can create a maximum of three clusters. After the Beta these parameters will be configurable, but we're currently limiting them to accommodate everyone.

      By default all Kubernetes and Swarm clusters are provisioned on a single node. We are working on multi-node capabilities for both cluster types.
  -
    question: Can I get access to the underlying node?
    answer: |
      Direct access to the underlying node (LXC container) won't be given to users. Carina is a managed container service; we run the infrastructure so you can focus on running your application.
  -
    question: Why can't my containers talk to each other?
    answer: |
      By default, containers are isolated and cannot "see" each other unless explicitly configured. See the [overlay networks tutorial]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/tutorials/overlay-networks/) to learn how to connect your containers.
  -
    question: When will Carina come out of Beta?
    answer: |
      We're not rushing to put Carina into production. We'd like to collect feedback and add more features as well as orchestration engines. When we have more detail on production readiness dates, we'll let you know.
  -
    question: How long will Carina be free? When you start charging, what will it cost?
    answer: |
      While Carina won't be free forever, we will continue to keep a free tier, even after we start charging. As soon as we have pricing details, we will make them public, so you can educate yourself long before we start charging. You'll be positively surprised.
  -
    question: When I run `docker info` against my Swarm cluster, there are already containers running there. Why?
    answer: |
      Docker Swarm requires an agent and manager to work. They currently run on cluster nodes in the form of containers. Although only one manager is required per cluster, we've configured it to run on all nodes in the cluster to add some redundancy and make communicating with the cluster easier. For more details, see the ["how" section of the overview article]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/overview-of-carina/#how-does-carina-work).
  -
    question: Is there an API for all this?
    answer: |
      Yes, we have an API, but it will change before we move into production. If you want to use it, start by using the CLI tool's code base. See [Getting Started with the Carina CLI]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/getting-started/getting-started-carina-cli/#download-and-install-carina-cli).
  -
    question: How are you currently preventing containers running in <code>--privileged</code> mode?
    answer: |
      AppArmor profiles at the compute host level deny certain capabilities and permissions that Docker needs for <code>--privileged</code>. When Docker tries to spawn a privileged container, AppArmor denies it. For more details, see [Understanding how Carina uses Docker Swarm]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/concepts/docker-swarm-carina/#apparmor-profiles).
  -
    question: What level of control do I get over node networking? How do I allocate IP addresses?
    answer: |
      Currently Carina controls all the networking for you. Every node is allocated a public IPv4 address, which makes connectivity easy, but should be considered when you are deploying Docker containers that expose services publicly.
  -
    question: Can I get access to the TLS certificates?
    answer: |
      For Docker Swarm clusters, of the certificates necessary to talk to the Docker daemon or Swarm manager are on each node. You can access them by using `--volumes-from swarm-data:ro`. You'll find them in `/etc/docker`. You can also access the local UNIX socket with `--volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock`.

      For Kubernetes clusters, the `ca.pem`, `user.pem` and `user-key.pem` are provided in the zip file per cluster. Access to other TLS certificates is not provided and should not be necessary.
  -
    question: What type of storage is available?
    answer: |
      Carina uses Enterprise SATA disks for storage and each node receives 20GB of space.

    This is a terrible, awful, no-good band-aid to parse one jekyll variable that we know gets used a lot in the frontmatter.
