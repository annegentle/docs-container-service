description: Provides a glossary of the terms used in Carina documentation
topics:
  - docker
  - containers
terms:
  -
    term: AppArmor profile
    definition: |
      A security layer in Carina that keeps container resources isolated. AppArmor is a Linux kernel security module. The profile denies access to sensitive file paths on the hosts, whitelists expected mount calls for the container file system, and restricts the device capabilities of the Docker process.
  -
    term: Carina
    definition: |
      A hosted container runtime environment provided by Rackspace. Carina is built on the open-source Docker Swarm and Kubernetes projects and provides bare-metal speeds, security, and portability for running your applications in containers.
  -
    term: Carina CLI
    definition: |
      A command-line interface for Carina that you can use to launch and control clusters on a Carina endpoint.
  -
    term: Carina Node
    definition: |
      A portion of the resources available in a cluster. Containers are housed in nodes on the cluster. A Carina node is an LXC container provisioned by libvirt.
  -
    term: Cluster
    definition: |
      A pool of compute, storage, and networking resources that serves as a host for one or more containerized applications. Carina provisions either Kubernetes or Docker Swarm clusters for running containers.
  -
    term: Container
    definition: |
      A userspace instance that packages a piece of software with a complete file system that contains everything that the software needs to run, such as code, system tools, and system libraries. Each container is an isolated and secure application platform. A container is created from an *image*. Containers can be run, started, stopped, moved, and deleted.
  -
    term: Control plane
    definition: |
      The component of Carina that takes the commands that you input in the UI or CLI and performs functions such as creating clusters and adding nodes to clusters.
  -
    term: Credentials
    definition: |
      A set of TLS certificates and environment configuration files that you need to download and use to authenticate to your Carina cluster.
  -
    term: DaemonSet
    definition: |
      A Kubernetes resource that ensures that all (or some) nodes run a copy of a pod.
  -
    term: Data volume
    definition: |
      A directory within a container that stores data and is meant to persist beyond the life cycle of the container. Data volumes can be shared and reused among containers, and they can be created in special *data volume containers*.
  -
    term: Data volume container (DVC)
    definition: |
      A container that houses one or more volumes and whose sole aim is to store data in a persistent way. DVCs are often used as a centralized data store across multiple containers on the same Docker Swarm host. Other containers can mount the volume inside a DVC and save their data to it, providing nonpersistent containers with a way to handle persistent storage.      
  -
    term: Deployment
    definition: |
      A Kubernetes resource that provides declarative updates for pods and Replica Sets. Deployments monitor and achieve the required state of a set of pods, making it easy to roll out and continuously update production workloads.
  -
    term: Docker
    definition: |
      An open-source, client-server platform for building, shipping, and running distributed applications in containers. Also referred to as the Docker Engine.
  -
    term: Docker client
    definition: |
      The primary user interface to Docker. The client accepts commands from users and communicates with the Docker *daemon*, which runs in the Docker host. In Carina, the client is configured to communicate with the nodes in a cluster.
  -
    term: Docker Compose
    definition: |
      A tool used to define and run multicontainer applications with Docker. With Compose, you use a YAML file to define a multicontainer application, and then start the application with a single command.
  -
    term: Docker daemon
    definition: |
      Runs in a Docker host and builds, runs, and distributes containers. Users interact with the daemon through the Docker *client*. Sometimes referred to as the Docker *server* or *engine*.  	
  -
    term: Docker host
    definition: |
      A machine that runs the *Docker daemon*. The host is also where images are built and containers are created. When Docker is run locally on Windows and Mac OS X machines, the host runs in a virtual machine built by the *Docker Machine*. In Carina clusters, the equivalent of a Docker host is a *node*.
  -
    term: Docker Hub
    definition: |
      The public Docker *registry* from which you can upload or download images.
  -
    term: Docker image
    definition: |
      A read-only template that is used to create Docker containers. For example, an image could contain an Ubuntu operating system with Apache and your web application installed. You can download public images or create your own. Images are stored in *registries*.
  -
    term: Docker Machine
    definition: |
      Software that enables you to create Docker hosts on your computer or in the cloud. It creates hosts, installs Docker on them, and configures the Docker client to talk to them. A machine is the combination of a Docker *host* and a Docker *client*. Docker Machine uses the `docker-machine` binary.  	
  -
    term: Docker Swarm
    definition: |
      A clustering tool for Docker. Swarm enables you to host and schedule a cluster of Docker containers. Carina uses Docker Swarm clusters.
  -
    term: Docker Toolbox
    definition: |
      Installs and sets up a Docker environment on a computer. Toolbox is available for Windows and Mac OS X, and it installs the Docker client, Docker Machine, Docker Compose (Mac only), Kitematic, and Oracle VM VirtualBox.
  -
    term: Dockerfile
    definition: |
      A text document that contains all of the commands that a user would call on the command line to assemble an *image*.
  -
    term: dvm
    definition: |
      Docker Version Manager. A cross-platform command-line tool that you can use to install and switch between Docker clients. Using dvm avoids and addresses the Docker client/server API mismatch error. Carina's credentials are designed to work with dvm. After you load your cluster credentials, run `dvm use`, and dvm will switch to the version of Docker used by your cluster.   
  -
    term: etcd
    definition: |
      A distributed key-value store by CoreOS.
  -
    term: Key-value store
    definition: |
      A type of data storage that allows data to be stored and retrieved using unique *keys*. Whereas relational databases predefine the data structure as a series of tables and columns with well-defined data types, key-value stores treat the data as an opaque collection that may have different fields for every record. This offers considerable flexibility.
  -
    term: Flannel
    definition: A virtual overlay network that gives a subnet to each host for use with container runtimes.
  -
    term: Ingress
    definition: |
      A Kubernetes resource that uses a collection of rules to match hosts and paths of external connections and routes them to internal cluster services. This feature is not installed on new clusters by default, so you must manually install it yourself.
  -
    term: kube-apiserver
    definition: |
      A server that runs on every master instance and validates and configures the data to manipulate Kubernetes resources, such as pods, services, and replication controllers. The API server services REST operations and provides the front end to the clusterâ€™s shared state through which all other components interact.
  -
    term: kubectl
    definition: |
      A Kubernetes CLI client that interacts with the kube-apiserver server.
  -
    term: kubelet
    definition: |
      The primary agent that runs on each Kubernetes node. The kubelet takes a set of *PodSpecs* that are provided through various mechanisms (primarily through the API server) and ensures that the containers described in those PodSpecs are running and healthy.
  -
    term: Kubernetes Node
    definition: |
      A host in the cluster that hosts container workloads. Each node has the services necessary to run pods and is managed by master instances. The services on a node include `docker`, `kubelet` and `kube-proxy`.
  -
    term: k8s
    definition: |
      A [numeronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeronym) for Kubernetes.
  -
    term: Labels
    definition: |
      Key-value pairs that are attached to Kubernetes resources, such as pods. Labels are meant to attach attributes that are meaningful and relevant to users. Labels are primarily important because they work with *selectors* to configure service load balancing. Users typically interact with labels rather than interacting with IP addresses or DNS entries directly.
  -
    term: Manifest
    definition: |
      A YAML or JSON object that describes the state and characteristics of a Kubernetes resource.
  -
    term: Master
    definition: |
      A compute resource that hosts components that administer the Kubernetes cluster, such as the API server, etcd, and the scheduler. All nodes connect to one or more master instances over HTTPS.
  -
    term: Microservices
    definition: |
      A software architecture style in which complex applications comprise small, independent processes that communicate with each other through APIs.
  -
    term: Namespace
    definition: |
      Provides a way to scope and categorize Kubernetes resources. The names of resources must be unique within a namespace, but not across namespaces. Namespaces are useful for bulk deleting associated resources rather than manually deleting multiple sets of resources.
  -
    term: NodePort
    definition: |
      A type of Kubernetes service that is exposed on a dedicated port on each node of the cluster. When configured, each node proxies that port into the service.
  -
    term: Overlay network
    definition: |
      An isolated network that allows containers to communicate with one another across all of the nodes in your cluster on Carina. Overlay networks add another layer of security to your application deployments, and run on an underlying network known as *ServiceNet*.
  -
    term: PersistentVolume
    definition: |
      *(Kubernetes)* A piece of networked storage in the cluster that has been provisioned. A PersistentVolume is similar to a Kubernetes volume, but it has a lifecycle independent of any individual pod that uses it. This API object captures the details of the implementation of the storage, be it NFS, iSCSI, or a cloud-provider-specific storage system.
  -
    term: PersistentVolumeClaim
    definition: |
      *(Kubernetes)* A request for storage by a user. It is similar to a pod resource: pods consume node resources and PersistentVolumeClaims consume PersistentVolume resources. Pods can request specific levels of resources (CPU and memory), and PersistentVolumeClaims can request specific size and access modes from a PersistentVolume (for example, can be mounted once read/write or many times read-only).
  -
    term: Pod
    definition: |
      *(Kubernetes)* A group of one or more containers. Containers within a pod share an IP address and port space, and can communicate with each other via localhost. Applications within a pod also have access to shared volumes, which are defined as part of a pod and are made available to be mounted into each applicationâ€™s file system. Pods are the smallest deployable units of computing that can be created and managed in Kubernetes.
  -
    term: PodSpec
    definition: |
      *(Kubernetes)* A YAML or JSON object (called a manifest) that describes a pod.
  -
    term: PublicNet
    definition: |
      A public network interface that connects Carina nodes to the public Internet. When you create a node, it gets an IPv4 and IPv6 address from PublicNet by default. This is the address that the node uses to communicate with the public Internet.
  -
    term: Registry
    definition: |
      An open-source service application that stores and distributes Docker images. You can run your own registry or use one of the publicly available registries. The public Docker registry is called *Docker Hub*.
  -
    term: Replica Set
    definition: |
      A Kubernetes resources that ensures that a specified number of pod *replicas* are running at any given time.
  -
    term: Resource
    definition: |
      An entity that is represented and be can be managed by the Kubernetes API. Examples include pods, secrets, and services.
  -
    term: Selector
    definition: |
      The means by which resources are identified. A selector functions as the core grouping primitive in Kubernetes. For example, suppose that a set of pods has the `app=wordpress` label. A replication controller resource identifies which pods it controls through a selector (the `.spec.selector` field), in this case `app=wordpress`. This allows resources to select other ones in a flexible and decoupled manner.
  -
    term: Service discovery
    definition: |
      The process of discovering what services are available for an application. Service discovery is a two-part process. *Registration* is the process of a service registering its location with a central directory. *Discovery* occurs when a client application asks the directory for the location of a service.
  -
    term: ServiceNet
    definition: |
      An internal, multi-tenant network interface that connects nodes within Carina. When you create a node, it gets only an IPv4 address from ServiceNet by default. This is the address that the node can use to communicate with other nodes in Carina.
  -
    term: Scheduler
    definition: |
      A mechanism that is responsible for the life cycle of a container. The scheduler chooses the best *node* to put the container in, and starts, stops, and destroys the container when requested. Different scheduler strategies can be used to pick the best node to hold a container. In Carina, the spread scheduler strategy is used.
  -
    term: Swarm agent
    definition: |
      The component on a node that accepts commands from the Docker Swarm *manager*. The agent communicates with the Docker Engine to perform the commands, such as running containers.
  -
    term: Swarm manager
    definition: |
      The component that orchestrates and schedules containers across an entire cluster. The Docker Swarm manager assigns containers to the nodes in the cluster via the Swarm *agent*.
  -
    term: Volume
    definition: |
      A resource that abstracts and represents a storage device. It is made available to containers and its life cycle is independent from them.
