Thank you to everyone who supported Carina by Rackspace. Your feedback, ideas and suggestions shaped the Carina experience and our own learning process. We are grateful for your input. At this time, we will be ending the Carina beta and shifting our focus to delivering a fully-managed Kubernetes offering.  

Effective immediately, we are closing new sign-ups and ending cluster support.  Existing users will be able to access Carina clusters until April 18th, at which time we will be shutting down Carina completely and removing all associated data. We regret any inconvenience this may cause and thank you again for your support of Carina by Rackspace. If you would like to learn more about Rackspace Kubernetes, or if you have any questions or feedback please feel free to reach out to us at [carina-support@rackspace.com](mailto:carina-support@rackspace.com).
