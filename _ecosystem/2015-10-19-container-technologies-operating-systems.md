*Use the container-oriented operating systems, CoreOS or Project Atomic, for the functionality required to deploy applications along with self-updating and healing properties.*

With the success and popularity of Docker containers, modern operating systems have emerged that embrace the container culture and are designed to work optimally with a container ecosystem. These operating systems tend to provide the minimal functionality required to deploy applications along with self-updating and healing properties that are different from today's standard maintenance-intensive operating systems. Container-oriented operating systems have evolved the traditional operating model by moving toward deploying applications inside containers and away from deploying applications at the application layer. More simply put, applications are self-contained binaries that you can move around in your container environments based on criteria such as quality of service, affinity, and replication.

### CoreOS from CoreOS

CoreOS, the operating system from the company of the same name, is a new Linux distribution that provides the features needed to run modern infrastructure stacks via containers with a hands-off approach to operating system updates. CoreOS' update philosophy is that "frequent, reliable updates are critical to good security" [(1)](#resources). Updates to CoreOS are distributed as they are available and can be installed immediately and automatically, much like the automated update process for browsers, such as Firefox. The strategies and architectures that influence CoreOS are similar to the mechanisms that allow companies like Google, Facebook, and Twitter to run their services at scale with high resilience.

In addition to self-updating, the CoreOS operating system
integrates seamlessly with CoreOS' other flagship products:

- **etcd**: A highly-available key-value store for shared configuration
  and service discovery.

- **fleet**: A distributed init system that uses etcd as its manifest
  and systemd as its mechanism for instantiating units. Units are
  configuration files that describe the properties of the process
  that you want to run. You can think of fleet as an extension of
  Debian's systemd that operates at the cluster level instead of the machine
  level, so it functions as a simple orchestration system for systemd
  units across your cluster.

You can learn more about
etcd at [Introduction to container technologies: registration and discovery of container services]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/best-practices/container-technologies-registration-discover/)
and more about
fleet at [Introduction to container technologies: scheduling and management of services and resources]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/best-practices/container-technologies-scheduling-management/).

### Project Atomic from Red Hat

Red Hatâ€™s Project Atomic facilitates application-centric IT architecture
by providing an end-to-end solution for deploying containerized
applications quickly and reliably. Atomic update and rollback for applications and hosts enables implementation of frequent, small improvements.

The core of Project Atomic is the Project Atomic Host, a
lightweight operating system that has been assembled from upstream RPM Package Manager (RPM) content. Project Atomic Host is designed to run applications in Docker containers.

Project Atomic hosts inherit the full features and advantages of their
base distributions [(2)](#resources). Hosts can be based on several Linux distributions:

- Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)
- Fedora
- CentOS [(3)](#resources)

Project Atomic takes advantage of key Linux capabilities:

- **systemd**: A system and service manager that provides
container dependency management and fault recovery.
- **journald**: A system logging methodthat provides secure aggregation and attribution of container
logs.
