### Containers meetup at OpenStack Summit Austin

It was great seeing so many faces at the containers meetup this week at the OpenStack Summit in Austin, Texas. We had a full day of containers talks which we have posted below.  For a preview, we've included a spiffy recap video that is only 2:30 in length.  Enjoy!
