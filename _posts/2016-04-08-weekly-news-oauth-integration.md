  Upcoming reboot
</h3>

The Linux kernel has a bug that affects containers and requires a reboot to resolve.
The Carina team will start rebooting all Carina instances on Tuesday, April 12th, at noon CST.
This process will take approximately 90 minutes. User nodes will be unavailable
for short periods of time throughout this process. Be sure to [check restart settings][restart-policies] and backup your data.

We will provide up-to-the-minute updates during the maintenance window on our [status page](https://carinabyrackspace.statuspage.io/).

For more information, see the [Linux kernel bug][kernel-bug] report.

### Integrate your application with Carina using OAuth

<img class="left" src="{% asset_path carina-oauth.png %}" style="height: 150px;" alt="Integrate ALL THE THINGS!"/>
Carina now supports OAuth v2 for integrating external applications!
With Carina OAuth, you can authenticate users, download their cluster credentials,
and create clusters on their behalf. This opens the door to some pretty interesting
"bring your own compute" scenarios, such as [howtowhale.com](https://howtowhale.com),
where Carolyn Van Slyck is using Carina to teach Docker directly in the web browser.

You can find full details about how to integrate can be found in the [OAuth integration][oauth-reference] reference guide.

### Effective Swarm

The intrepid Everett Toews gave Docker Austin the [rundown on Docker Swarm][swarm-talk] last night
covering everything from Docker Swarm basics to advanced topics, such as networking and service discovery.
Those who began the night wondering _"How do I even Swarm?"_ left with best practices for effectively leveraging
Docker Swarm and fun ideas for how to use it.
