{{ page.excerpt }} We've got some great news: with the OpenStack summit joining
us in Austin the week of April 25th we've worked with a lot of amazing people to
get a dedicated demo/discussion/hack space for containers!

For this year’s OpenStack Summit, [Rackspace wanted to create a place](http://blog.rackspace.com/relax-recharge-rackspace-cantina-openstack-summit-austin/)
where attendees could power down and chill, or power up. Any OpenStack Summit
attendee can come join us across the street from the summit to geek out about
containers, Docker, Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, etc. for all three days (April 25-27).

The Carina team has a dedicated space with screens, tables, and the team to focus
on building, creating, and discussing all things containers.

### But it gets cooler!

What's great is that we're not just inviting Summit attendees! We're not just
inviting Summit attendees! *We're also inviting any other container
ecosystem/Carina interested people to join us Tuesday, April 26, from 12pm-5pm
for a dedicated meet up!*


We have a full array of speakers, including:

* [Ross Kukulinski](https://twitter.com/rosskukulinski), of NodeSource, talking about *Using Carina in Production*
* [Lee Calcote](https://twitter.com/lcalcote) talking about *Characterizing and Comparing Container Orchestrators*
* [Tim Hockin](https://twitter.com/thockin), senior software engineer @ Google, talking about *Pain Management for Container Apps*
* Our own [Everett Toews](https://twitter.com/everett_toews), talking about *Effective Docker Swarm*

### Ermahgersh! how do I sign up if I'm not a Summit attendee?

If you're a Summit attendee, you're already in/invites. If not, just
[sign up here, for free](http://www.cvent.com/d/pfq4wl/4W), so we know we can
have enough food, drink, stickers etc. Y'all are welcome, summit attendee or no!

[No seriously sign up here](http://www.cvent.com/d/pfq4wl/4W).

When you come, just tell the Rackers out front you're a Carina guest. *Boom*

### Where do I go?

I'm glad you asked that. Here is a fully interactive Google Map that reveals
the location of the hidden rebel base.

### Join us!

Grab a t-shirt or sticker, have a drink and a bite to eat, and chat containers with us.
Hack on applications, learn, and experiment. It's all fair! We're geeks, so
we're not focused on ABC (always be closing) we use ABc (always be containerizing).
