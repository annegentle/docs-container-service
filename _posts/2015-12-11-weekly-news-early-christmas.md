## Deploying secure web applications

<img class="right" src="{% asset_path 2015-12-11-weekly-news/lock.png %}" alt="The Green Lock of TLSdom"/>In this post, Lars Butler shows you what he's found to be the path of least resistance in getting a secure web application up and running on the Rackspace Cloud. First he takes you quickly through the process of creating an SSL certificate, and then he shows you how to deploy an application using Carina and Docker. Whether you've deployed HTTPS applications dozens of times, or you've never done it once, this guide should have something useful for you.
