### PyCon wrap up

We had a great showing at our Carina workshop and our booth at PyCon.  Everett Toews and Ash Wilson presented a [workshop](https://us.pycon.org/2016/schedule/presentation/2263/) "Deploy an Interactive Data Science Environment With JupyterHub On Docker Swarm" to a captive audience.  If you're thinking "Dang! I wish I had been able to attend," you're in luck!  You can [access the deck](http://getcarina.github.io/jupyterhub-tutorial/slides/#/welcome) to view and follow along with the presentation.  Happy hacking!

### Docker 1.11.1 and release notes

Docker put out a patch release about a month ago and we quickly followed by implementing the changes in Carina on May 23.  The release fixes some bugs that were reported after the 1.11.0 release.  You can find the [change log](https://github.com/docker/docker/releases/tag/v1.11.1) and a [side-by-side comparison](https://github.com/docker/docker/compare/v1.11.0...v1.11.1) of the different versions in the Docker GitHub repo.  Changes include a chunk of runtime fixes and some changes to networking, documentation, the builder, and distribution.

In addition to the Docker updates, we also have improved our error messages related to security restrictions.  You can find more information on our [error codes](https://getcarina.com/docs/reference/error-codes/) page.

### Upcoming appearances

We'll be representing at [Dockercon 16](http://2016.dockercon.com/) this year, so come to the expo and chat with us about Carina and all things containers.  You can enter into our Carina contest, with a chance to win a Parrot Bebop Quadcopter Drone. Your neighbors will love you.
