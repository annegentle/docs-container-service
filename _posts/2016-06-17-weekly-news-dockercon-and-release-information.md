### Docker 1.11.2 and release notes

We deployed Docker Engine 1.11.2 today.

![Deploy like no on is watching]({% asset_path weekly-news/friday-deploy.jpg %})

For more information, see the [release notes](https://github.com/docker/docker/releases/tag/v1.11.2) and a [side-by-side comparison](https://github.com/docker/docker/compare/v1.11.1...v1.11.2) of the different versions in the Docker Engine repo.

Docker Engine 1.11.2 includes a key fix for [containers that fail to start after a daemon restart if they depend on a containerized cluster store](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/22561). When you set `restart=always`, your containers should always restart, even if the host reboots.

To stay up-to-date with ongoing release notes, maintenance, and any incidents, see our [status page](https://status.getcarina.com/).

### DockerCon 2016

We're representing at [DockerCon](http://2016.dockercon.com/) next week, so come to the expo and chat with us about Carina and all things containers. You can enter our Carina contest, with a chance to win a Parrot Bebop Quadcopter. Your neighbors will love you.
