### Learning how to whale

[Learn How to Whale]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/learning-how-to-whale/) with JupyterHub, and use Carina to provide a Bring Your Own Compute experience to users that encourages interactivity, play, and sharing. How to Whale is an online platform that Carolyn Van Slyck created to teach Docker. Just log in with your Carina account and in minutes you have an interactive scripting notebook in your web browser. From there you can run Docker commands without having to install a thing.

### Migrate to a new cluster

Here's how to [migrate to a new cluster]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/tutorials/migrate-cluster/) to take advantage of new features, security, services, and Docker versions. It demonstrates how to manage different Docker versions and how to move data from one cluster to another, and offers some tips to make the process go more smoothly in the future.

### Docker client behind corporate proxy

This week we had a very determined user wanting to run the [Docker client behind corporate proxy](https://community.getcarina.com/t/docker-client-behind-corporate-proxy/205) so he could use Carina from his workplace. He came up with a nifty solution in this [docker-proxy](https://github.com/vertigobr/docker-proxy) repository on GitHub. In his own words, "Docker HTTPS proxy - to use when docker client and engine are separated by a corporate proxy (Carina users will love it)."

### Upcoming appearances

Next week, O'Reilly's annual open source convention, [OSCON](http://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/open-source-us), will take place in Austin, TX. Catch members of the Carina team at any of these events:

* Tuesday at 9:05am, as part of Open Container Day, our own Everett Toews is hosting an [Intro to Docker Swarm](http://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/open-source-us/public/schedule/detail/50961) tutorial.
* Wednesday at 11:05am, Everett will be presenting [Effective Docker Swarm](http://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/open-source-us/public/schedule/detail/51213) to share additional insights on developing and deploying real-world applications on Docker Swarm.
* Wednesday at 2:40pm, Carolyn Van Slyck, Nick Silkey, and Ash Wilson will be presenting [Think outside the container](http://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/open-source-us/public/schedule/detail/51253), an exploration of unconventional use-cases for Docker containers.
