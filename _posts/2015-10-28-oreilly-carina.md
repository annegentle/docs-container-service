[O'Reilly Media](http://www.oreilly.com) has been incredibly lucky to be an early beta user for [Carina](https://getcarina.com/), and we're honored to share our story at Carina's official launch at the [Openstack Summit 2015](https://www.openstack.org/summit/) in Tokyo:

We became involved with the project through our efforts to [offer Jupyter Notebooks as a first class authoring environment](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/jupyter-at-oreilly).  Since that time, we've worked with a wide range of talented authors to expand this vision, which of course has lead to a growing requirement for a stable and flexible environment to run the underlying containers.

Carina has been exactly what we've been hoping for: a simultaneously simple to use, yet powerfully scalable way to manage our container infrastructure.  (Or, more accurately, have someone else manage them for us!) It's enabling us to explore much richer formats that go well beyond the simple articles we've offered so far.  

We're eager to continue using Carina to push the boundaries of how developers can keep up with changes in technology.
