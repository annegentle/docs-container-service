This tutorial explains the basic components of Docker and provides a starting place for installing and using Docker.

### What is Docker?

Docker is an open-source project that automates the deployment of applications into [containers]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/concepts/containers-101/). It's an easy-to-use tool that allows you to interact with and run your code in a lightweight and fast environment.

Using Docker offers several benefits:

* Docker uses libcontainer, which provides features such as cgroups and namespaces for process isolation. Because of this isolation, Docker containers take only seconds to launch. Furthermore, libcontainer doesn't rely only on Linux based components. It allows for Google, Microsoft, and Mac integrations, while still using Linux distributions.

* Docker uses a copy-on-write file system, which enables you to easily link containers to other containers. This feature encourages enterprise and service-oriented architectures. Although each container still runs a single application or process, linking enables you to create a series of interconnected containers, making it easy for you to distribute, scale, and triage your own applications.

* Docker ensures that your code environment and deployment environment are consistent, reducing the risk of deployment issues.

### How does Docker work?

Docker is made up of these core concepts:

* The Docker client and daemon
* Docker images
* Docker containers

#### Docker client and daemon
Docker uses a RESTful API and a command-line client called `docker`. These clients interact with the Docker daemon. The daemon is a server that automates the processes that manage containers.

Both the client and the daemon can run on the same host, as shown in the following diagram.

#### Docker images
Containers use images similar to how servers use images. They act as the operating environment for your containers. You can either use images uploaded by other users onto [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/explore/) or create your own images.

In addition to using Docker Hub for shared images, you can also use it to store any images you have created. You can choose to make these images public or keep them private.

To store or share images, you need to create a Docker Hub account. Accounts are [free to sign up](https://hub.docker.com/).

#### Docker containers
Unlike virtual machines, which require a full operating system (OS), hypervisor, and guest operating systems before an application can be deployed, Docker containers are lightweight because they use the host's OS.

Docker containers contain an image, a set of standard operations, and an execution environment. The image is your container's operating environment (for example, Ubuntu). A container can perform a set of standard operations; for example, it can be created, started, or destroyed. Lastly, the execution environment decides how the containers are deployed.

### Docker and Carina

Because Docker containers are interchangeable, when an application is deployable with containers, a host is needed in order to take your build from local to scalable. Carina by Rackspace is a hosted environment that uses Docker. You can use Carina to deploy your applications from multiple containers in a cluster.

To learn more, see [Overview of Carina]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/overview-of-carina/)

### Install Docker
To create a local Docker environment, use the following instructions to install Docker for your OS:

* [Install Docker on Mac OS X]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/tutorials/docker-install-mac/)
* [Install Docker on Linux]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/tutorials/docker-install-linux/)
* [Install Docker on Windows]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/tutorials/docker-install-windows/)

###Next step
To get a local Docker environment up and running, move through the paths in the preceding installation articles .

To get started with the hosted environment of Carina, read the [Overview of Carina]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/overview-of-carina/) and then see how easy it is to run an application in a container by completing the steps in [Getting started with Docker Swarm]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/getting-started/create-swarm-cluster/).
